# MART-341 WEB DEVELOPMENT
## Week-03 Responsive Web Design
### 1. SUMMARY

Week three of MART-341 introduced us to the techniques and coding that go into creatiing a web page. During this week we covered;

- **Html**- Hypertext markup language,Language that builds the structure of a document
- **Elements**- Individual components of a HTML
- **Tags**- syntactically unique code that is used to describe text within a document
- **Opening and Closing tags**- Used to identify the beggining and ending of an element. Only difference in closing tags have '/'
- **Attributes**- Indicates the different information of an element, eg. language tyle, font size, colour etc

### 2. My Web Page process
1. Open ATOM editor
2. Indicate type of HTML- <!DOCTYPEhtml>
3. Fill in basic structure given, including tags; doctype, html, head, meta and body
4. Add title- Using tag `<tag>My First Web page</tag>`
5. Next add a heading- using tag `<h1>Olivia Gomes</h1>`
6. Add first paragraph- `<p>Hello world</p>`
7. Add second paragraph, but this time using italics-`<p>This is my <em>first</em>web page</p>`
8. Next add a poem- To do this I first created a heading 1 `<h1>` naming my poem, next I added heading 2 `<h2>` with the poets name, finally I added my poem, by using the tags `<pre></pre>`
9. Finally close all open tags, includes body tag and html tag.

**NOTE**: Always remember to add a `/` forward slash when closing a tag.
**Eg**- open a paragraph tag `<p>`,close a paragraph tag `</p>`

### 3. Make My WebPage LIVE!

To make my Wenpage live, I first had to inform GitHub that I wanted to turn my repo into a webpage. To do this I opened my repository and went intothe settings tab. Next I scrolled to the GitHub pages section and selected Master Bracnch under the source dropdown. Once entered a URL appears. Copy this URL into a new tab and insert the name of new created webpage, in this case Week-03-hw/, at the end of the given URL. Press enter. The newly loaded page displays the new webpage.

### 4. Issues

This week was a great week, I really enjoyed making my webpage and I did not come accross too many difficulties following the assignment this week, however the it did take me a few tries determining how to make my webpage live. This was due to the fact that I had forgotten to add the backslash after adding my project name to the URL. Another issue I came across was remembering how to add my repository to GitHub, however this was also very quickly solved.
